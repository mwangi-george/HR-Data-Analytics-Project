# HR-Data-Analytics-Project
This repository hosts a Human Resource Analytics Project executed using R programming. My main focus is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predict employee behavior using a dataset I downloaded from Kaggle.
The dataset contains information about employees who worked in an unknown company. The columns in the dataset include:

  Satisfaction level (on a scale of 0-1)
  last evaluation (on a scale of 0-1)
  Number of projects
  Average monthly hours 
  Time spent in the company in years
  Work accident (1 if one had an accident, 0, otherwise)
  Left (1 if left, 0 otherwise)
  Promotion last five years (1 if promoted, 0 otherwise)
  Department 
  Salary (low, medium or high)

### Project Objectives 
1. To determine which variables have a direct and clear impact on employee retention, i.e. whether they leave the company or continue to work. Achieve this using EDA.
2. To determine the impact of the various employee salary categories (low, medium, and high) on employee retention. Make a visualization for this task.
3. To identify the correlation between employee department and their retention. Make a visualization for this task.
4. To build a logistic regression model using the variables that were narrowed down in step 1. Measure the accuracy of the model.
